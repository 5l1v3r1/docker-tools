This is based on [Running Your Own RBL DNS Blacklist](http://www.blue-quartz.com/rbl/) using the Debian rbldnsd
package adapted from scripts published by Herb Rubin some years
ago. This attempts to counter large-scale botnets (with hundreds of
thousands of scattered IP addresses) that spammers use to bypass the
well-known DNSBL sites. We do this by examining known-spam messages'
Received headers, and inserting their source IP addresses into a local
MySQL table, almost immediately blacklisting against multiple uses of
any given source IP. This tool maintains that table and provides a
local DNSBL which you can add to Spamassassin's rules. To make the
most use of it, set up honeypot email addresses separate from your
primary users' addresses; greylisting unknown senders for several
minutes will add to this protection.

### Usage
Before running it, grant access to a mysql user thus:
~~~bash
    USER=blacklister
    PSWD=xxx
    mysql> GRANT SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT,CREATE ON `blacklist`.* TO
     '$USER'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY '$PSWD';
~~~
Add a mysql-blacklist-user that contains the $PSWD you've set:
~~~bash
    # docker secret create mysql-blacklist -
    user=blacklister
    password=$PSWD
~~~
Decide on a subdomain name, such as blacklist.yourdomain.com. Set that
name as an environment variable RBL_DOMAIN. To delegate to this
subdomain, list hosts where you'll be running this in environment
variable NS_SERVERS (if you're running a swarm cluster, this will be
the DNS names of the cluster nodes).

In the local.cf file for spamassassin (separate Docker image), define
these rules for your local blacklist:

~~~
score    HONEY_RCVD_IN_RBL  4.5
header   HONEY_RCVD_IN_RBL  eval:check_rbl('bl', 'blacklist.yourdomain.com.', '127.0.0.2')
describe HONEY_RCVD_IN_RBL  Seen in rbldnsd by honeypot address
tflags   HONEY_RCVD_IN_RBL  net
reuse    HONEY_RCVD_IN_RBL

(Below items are performed by scripts in postfix-python image.)

Then to add new IPs into the blacklist, set up procmail to run the
honeypot-ip.py parser script (included here under src directory) to
insert into the MySQL ips table upon receipt of any known spam message.
Example:
~~~bash
    :0fw
    #| /usr/local/bin/honeypot-ip.py --db-config ~/.my.cnf -q \
      --honeypot honeyforbees@instantlinux.net \
      --relay 'by mx-caprica.?\.easydns\.com' --cidr-min-size 32
~~~
Add a .my.cnf file with db credentials:
~~~
    [client]
    host=xdb00
    database=blacklist
    user=blacklist
    password=xxx
~~~
This script can also be invoked as a spamfilter under postfix; use
the --pipe-stdout command option for that use case.

Launch this docker image in kubernetes or docker-compose using one of the
files provided here. This repo has complete instructions for
[building a kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/README.md) where you can launch [kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/blacklist/kubernetes.yaml) with the Makefile or:
~~~
cat kubernetes.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
~~~
