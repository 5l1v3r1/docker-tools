A python-3.7 image for running applications under alpine and UWSGI. See the requirements.txt file for the list of pypi packages included. They are built using _pip install_. I have found that the rapid succession of python 3.6 -> 3.7 -> 3.8 runtime environments in 2019/20 made shared-library installation too fragile using the Alpine py3-xxx package repos.

### Usage
Use this as a FROM in your application Dockerifle, such as:
```
FROM instantlinux/python-builder:latest

WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY requirements.txt uwsgi.ini /usr/src/
RUN pip3 install -r /usr/src/requirements.txt
    mkdir /var/opt/app && chown uwsgi /var/opt/app

COPY app/ /opt/app
RUN chmod -R g-w,o-w /opt/app

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["uwsgi", "--ini", "/usr/src/uwsgi.ini"]
```
