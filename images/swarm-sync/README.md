## swarm-sync

This HA tool provides sync for persistent storage between two swarm nodes,
with automatic recovery after a failure of either node.

If you don't have a SAN or cloud-infrastructure to support persistent
volumes, build a stack using this container. Then your other stacks can
reference volume mount points as subdirectories of /var/lib/docker/share.

At present this is far easier to set up than other clustering technologies.

### Usage

To generate an ssh keypair for synchronization and label your nodes,
invoke the following:
~~~bash
PRIMARY=<host1> PEER=<host2> make label_nodes
make
~~~
Then deploy the stack:
~~~
docker stack deploy -c ../../swarm-sync.yml swarm-sync
~~~
Then use this compose-file constraint in your stack definitions:

~~~yml
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      placement:
        constraints:
        - node.labels.swarm-sync-member == true
~~~
For monitoring, put nagios-nrpe-swarm-sync.cfg into your /etc/nagios
directory and add an NRPE check_swarm_sync check to the primary host's
list of services. Set the warning/critical values as appropriate for
your polling frequency in the cfg file.
