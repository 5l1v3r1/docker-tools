Run your central rsyslog in a high-availability container on top of shared storage. Then send all that into Splunk or wherever.

Why is this image customized? I couldn't find a stock Docker rsyslogd image that includes logrotate. This also includes the rsyslog-mysql module, which you can use to send logs to a database.

### Usage

Set up a load balancer with your desired port number and aim it at this. Put your /etc/rsyslog.d and /etc/logrotate.d customizations into read-only volume mounts. Map /var/log to a persistent volume if you want to preserve it. There's really not much to this.

Example kubernetes and docker-compose resource definition files are provided here. This repo has complete instructions for
[building a kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/README.md) where you can deploy [kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/rsyslogd/kubernetes.yaml) with the Makefile or:
~~~
cat kubernetes.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
~~~
