Git pull, plain and simple (why wasn't there already a published
container to do this)?

### Usage

See the docker-compose.yml file for a simple example (add additional
services to pick up content pulled by this image). A Makefile is
provided to generate the deploy key as a Docker secret; after doing so,
upload the new public key to your git server.
