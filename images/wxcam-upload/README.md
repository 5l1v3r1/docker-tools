This wraps an upload script along with proftpd for publishing still images from network-attached webcams to the Weather Underground webcam server.

### Usage

Sign up with Weather Underground to get a user login, and set up one or more webcams. Add secrets to your Docker Swarm installation (or define them as plain-text files), and set parameters as defined below. An example compose file is provided here in docker-compose.yml. This repo has complete instructions for
[building a kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/README.md) where you can deploy [kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/wxcam-upload/kubernetes.yaml) using _make_ and customizing [Makefile.vars](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/Makefile.vars) after cloning this repo:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools.git
cd docker-tools/k8s
make wxcam-upload
