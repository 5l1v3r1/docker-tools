Weather station software WeeWX

This includes WeeGreen skin; see the [live site](http://wx.ci.net) for
an example.

### Usage

First create secrets as defined below, in /var/adm/admin/secrets.

Then deploy this service, see the example docker-compose.yml (won't
run in swarm if you need a devices section). Available
environment variables are below.

To create the external-facing web site, use the simple nginx.conf
configuration provided here. You can run nginx under docker swarm with
the wx-nginx.yml stack definition (see stacks directory at top level
of this repo).

### Secrets

Secret | Description
------ | -----------
weewx-db-password | database password for MySQL
weewx-rsync-sshkey | private ssh key for rsync upload
weewx-wunderground-apikey | API key for Wunderground.com
weewx-wunderground-password | password for Wunderground.com

### Notes

This can't run in swarm because it needs to attach the
weather stations as devices, and docker-compose doesn't support 
"external" secrets outside a swarm so currently they have to
be stored as plain-text files.

Output logging from weewx is a bit of a mess: when running
in foreground, a lot of verbose clutter appears on stdout; the
real logs go to syslog and there's no configuration method to
send these elsewhere (like stdout to conform to Docker's logging
standard). So the SYSLOG_DEST environment variable provided here
can provide a way to send proper logging (via the rsyslogd
process included in this image) to a central syslog service.
