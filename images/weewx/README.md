Weather station software WeeWX

This includes WeeGreen skin; see the [live site](http://wx.ci.net) for an example. 
Two architectures are supported; look for [amd64](https://hub.docker.com/r/instantlinux/weewx/) (Intel/AMD) and [armhf](https://hub.docker.com/r/instantlinux/weewx-armhf/) (Raspberry Pi) images on Docker Hub.

### Usage

First create secrets as defined below, in /var/adm/admin/secrets.
Ensure your weather station device (usually /dev/ttyUSB0) is
read/writeable by user "weewx" (uid 2071) or by gid 20 (group
"dialout") via udev rules--all other parameters can be set as below.

Then deploy this service with docker-compose; see the example
docker-compose.yml. Available environment variables are below.

To create the external-facing web site, use the simple nginx.conf
configuration provided [here](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/weewx/nginx.conf) under docker swarm with
the docker-compose-nginx.yml stack definition, or (even easier) under
Kubernetes deploy the [wx-nginx.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/wx-nginx.yaml) resource definition.

| STATION_ID | unset | Weather Underground station ID |
| STATION_TYPE | Vantage | station type (see [usersguide](http://www.weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm) |
| SYSLOG_DEST | /var/log/messages | Syslog file or TCP dest (@@host:port) |
| TZ | US/Eastern | Local timezone |
| TZ_CODE | 10 | Davis VantagePro timezone code see [index](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/586601/Davis-Vantage-Pro.html?page=39) |

| WX_USER | weewx | run-as username |
| XTIDE_LOCATION | unset | xtide setting, see [index](http://tides.mobilegeographics.com/) |

You can volume-mount a different skin to a subdirectory of /home/weewx/skins if you prefer one that isn't already included.

### Secrets

Secret | Description
------ | -----------
weewx-db-password | database password for MySQL
weewx-rsync-sshkey | private ssh key for rsync upload
weewx-wunderground-apikey | API key for Wunderground.com
weewx-wunderground-password | password for Wunderground.com

### Notes

This can't run in swarm because it needs to attach the weather
stations as devices. Currently, docker-compose doesn't support
"external" secrets outside a swarm so they have to be stored as
plain-text files.

Tide info for US locations is generated by a library called
[xtide](http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/); there's no binary package for it in Alpine Linux
so a somewhat complicated set of commands is included here to package
it from source within Dockerfile.

Output logging from weewx is a bit of a mess: when running
in foreground, a lot of verbose clutter appears on stdout; the
real logs go to syslog and there's no configuration method to
send these elsewhere (like stdout to conform to Docker's logging
standard). So the SYSLOG_DEST environment variable provided here
can provide a way to send proper logging (via the rsyslogd
process included in this image) to a central syslog service.
