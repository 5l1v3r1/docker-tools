This image includes pyzor, razor2 and dcc (with proper initialization of
razor2 upon container start). The rules update can be scheduled to run at an
interval specified in cron.

### Usage
To add local rules, create a rules file for
/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf and map that file into the
container. To ensure that updated rules survive container restart,
make sure the /var/lib/spamassassin home directory is mounted to a
named volume. See the docker-compose.yml file here for an example.
