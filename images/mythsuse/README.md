### Usage

This image must be run in network_mode:host in order to communicate with HD Homerun tuners; assign a new IP address and hostname for this application, and define it as a secondary IP address on your Docker host's primary interface.

For configuration, see the example docker-compose.yml. Set environment variables and secrets as defined here, then run "docker-compose up -d".

Reach mythtv-setup in the usual way; default password is mythtv:

Change the password by generating a new hashed password and setting mythtv-user-password secret.
