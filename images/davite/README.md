## davite

DaVITE is an event-invitations server modeled after eVite, written in
2001 by David Madison. This image wraps it in a layer of the official
httpd Apache image.

### Usage
Set the variables as defined below, and run the docker-compose stack. The
service will be visible as http://host/cgi-bin/DaVite.cgi. Create an
invitation by entering your email address; that will generate a URI which
you can then use to edit your event invitation

### Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| HOSTNAME | | External DNS name of DaVite service |
| SCHEME | http | Set to https if behind SSL proxy |
| SMTP_SMARTHOST | smtp | Outbound email relay hostname |
| SMTP_PORT | 587 | Port for sending emails (no auth) |
| TZ | US/Pacific | time zone |
