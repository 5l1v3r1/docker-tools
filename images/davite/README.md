DaVITE is an event-invitations server modeled after eVite, written in
2001 by David Madison. This image wraps it in a layer of the official
httpd Apache image.

### Usage
Set the variables as defined below, and run with docker-compose or
kubernetes. The service will be visible as
http://host/cgi-bin/DaVite.cgi. Create an invitation by entering your
email address; that will generate a URI which you can then use to edit
your event invitation.

This repo has complete instructions for
[building a kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/k8s/README.md) where you can deploy [kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/master/images/davite/kubernetes.yaml) with the Makefile or:
~~~
cat kubernetes.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
~~~

### Variables
